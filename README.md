# About me

Welcome to my profile! My name is **Rojohn**, and I am currently 20 years old. Since I was a kid, I have **loved playing video games**, and that passion is still alive up until now.

In my second year of high school, I discovered the seed for my programming path through the ICT subject, even though I only learned a few basic **Office skills** and **GIMP**. In my fourth year of high school, I reinforced my **informatic knowledge** a little bit, because I learned basic hardware things, such as pc components and how worked more or less.

In baccalaureate I got my first touch with programming, I started with **PseInt** to learn the basis of coding through pseudocode and then we did some **Java** programs. I also learned **HTML**, **CSS**, and did little things with **WordPress** and **FileZilla**.

In the University I learned **C++** and **C**, however my knowledge about programming didn't increase until the beginning of 2023, when I remembered a friend said something about a 42 Piscine. I tried it out, passed the test, the Piscine and I'm currently a student.

During the Piscine I learned a lot, specially about the **C** language, **Git**, **Shell** and **Bash**. I also discovered that I love being **autodidactic**.

Nowadays, I keep **learning every day** and trying to **improve myself**.

# Skills

- **Git**: I used git for around **5 months** as well.
